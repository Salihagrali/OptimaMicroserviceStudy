I am studying microservices using the book "Spring Microservices in Action, Second Edition" by John Carnell and Illary Huaylupo Sánchez (2021). Since it's been four years since its release, many things in the code have become deprecated. I’m working to resolve these issues while studying and implementing the examples from the book.

I’ll try to keep things simple. Unfortunately, unlike the original GitHub repo provided by the authors, there is no chapter-wise organization. You can check my Git commit history to see what I’ve done and how I’ve resolved the problems I encountered.
